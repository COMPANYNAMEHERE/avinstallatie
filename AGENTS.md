# Agent Guidelines

- Prefer updating TypeScript and CSS within `src/` using modern, modular patterns.
- When editing localized copy, keep translations in `src/content.*.ts` synchronized across languages.
- Documentation should remain technical and task-focused; avoid marketing fluff in repository docs.
- Run `npm run build` before submitting substantial frontend changes to ensure the Vite bundle succeeds.
